# MM3
A MagicMirror2 Markdown clone (built using Obsidian).

Client-side files are either Markdown, CSS, or maybe JavaScript; server-side files are written in Python.

This only supports specific MM2 modules (weather, time, potentially Spotify rich presence), and it's custom-built for my personal use; I just decided to show it here on GitHub as well. While pull requests may be made, and I'm perfectly fine with them being made, I'm going to deny 99.9% of them, because like I said, this was built by me for me (sorry!).

Regardless of that, there should be some documentation (I'm writing this at 11:00 PM on a Thursday night, I make no promises whatsoever). If there's not for a specific part (or all of it :p ), open an issue, and please tell me what file(s), etc.

The entire idea behind this clone is something that can be used on *any* OS, not **just** Linux-based OSes, with the only required installed programs being Python. Because of this, I've had to figure out ways to still use the same (or similar) code from the original modules, or, in some cases, just rewrite the entire MM2 module for ease-of-development.

I guess that's everything (so far, at least). More updates should be pushed to this file with every update. If it's not, check the [roadmap(s)](ROADMAP.md).
